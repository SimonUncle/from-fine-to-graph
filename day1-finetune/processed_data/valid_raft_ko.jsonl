According to Sony, the new W series of Walkmans will boast various features which make them ideal for use in various physical activities such as sports. Sony has announced the availability of its latest additions to its W series of rugged portable media players that are sold under the Walkman branding. Known as the Sony Walkman MWD-W263, the Walkmans are claimed to be suitable for use in activities such as exercises and sports because of their lightweight and waterproof designs. According to Sony, the new MWD-W263 boasts a 25% weight reduction over its predecessors, while the lack of a headphone cord ensures that users do not have to worry about any potential distractions in the midst of their exercises. In addition, the MWD-W263 comes preloaded with various frills associated with the Walkman brand, such as Sony's Clear Audio Technology and Quick Charge feature, which allows users to enjoy up to 60 minutes of audio playback uptime with just a mere three minute charge. Last but not least, Sony has confirmed that the MWD-W263 will feature 4GB of internal flash storage and will support a variety of common audio formats, namely MP3, WMA, ATRAC, Linear PCM and AAC. Unfortunately, it seems that FLAC support is still not present in the new NWD-W263 Walkman. Oh well. Sony has not released any details about the new Walkman MWD-W263's pricing or global availability, although the Japanese electronics giant has confirmed that the media player is expected to be released for sale in Japan in four different colours (blue, pink, white and black) come September 10 this year, Source: Sony Japan\n\n컨텍스트 3: Euphorbiaceae Manihot esculenta Crantz, Manihot sp.

The plant is a large herbaceous shrub up to 10 feet, resembling castor bean in appearance, with large, compound leaves. It is cultivated for the large, tuberous roots which are rich in starch and are the source of tapioca, Brazilian arrow root, and other foods. The tuberous roots form in a cluster at the stem base. Plants are propagated by stem pieces laid horizontally in furrows, somewhat like sugar cane. The roots used as food sources are formed entirely underground.

Sony is finally delivering on the Tokyo Game Show promise of the PlayStation Vita coming into the PS Plus fold. It begins on November 19 with a new firmware update that also has some cool features arriving for the handheld. First things first; what many treasures does being a PS Plus subscriber hold for a PS Vita owner? Many of the same premium services its big brother PS3 gets – the typical amenities – cloud save storage, PS Store discounts, and an instant game collection. Psst… that’s PR speak for free games. Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Gravity Rush, Wipeout 2048, Jet Set Radio, Tales From Space: Mutant Blob Attack!, and Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions (PlayStation Portable) to be specific. Those PS Vita games and a rotating selection of others will be added to download and keep in the near future, so long as you pay the required PS Plus subscription fee of either $17.99 for 3 months or $49.99 for a whole year. Before you can enjoy all that digital goodness though – and a mighty splendid offering it is – you’ll first have to download firmware update version 2.00 that gives the PS Vita a spanking new email app, wireless content transferring between the portable and the PC, and improvements to the web browser. The PS Vita’s email app allows for multiple accounts and pop-up notifications while the web browser is better optimized for HTML5 and uses more of the system’s on-board memory for better stability. Hmm, I wonder if that means PS Vita users will be able to access it during a paused game without it causing a O.S. crash? I guess we’ll see. Hey, do you want to see 10 real products inspired by Film & TV or a stackable Tetris-themed led lamp?

The best locations in Yunguilla are less than an hour’s drive southwest of Cuenca (a car is a necessity in Yunguilla.) The scenery in every direction is stunning, with impossibly-green farmland surrounded by mountains, which showcase an ever-changing palette of shade and color caused by the movement of the sun and clouds. Yunguilla offers a myriad of opportunities for nature lovers, including world-class bird watching, a network of great hiking trails, and horseback riding with local guides. Above the small town of Girón is a breathtakingly spectacular waterfall. The area is also known for a home-brewed liquor that the locals make from sugar cane. You can tour the cane farms and see the distillation process first-hand. There are also coffee, banana, orange, and papaya plantations nearby. Rentals are scarce and rarely advertised. Finding them usually requires “knowing someone who knows someone who knows someone.” Purchase options vary from starter homes to farms to posh estates, and prices are extremely affordable. To give you an idea of property prices, a 7.5-acre parcel of land with water, electricity, and wonderful views is currently on the market for $40,000. How about a “handyman special”? A 2,200-square-foot, four-bedroom, two-bathroom adobe home is being offered at only $45,000. It’s perched on an elevated quarter-acre lot where you can see for miles in every direction. A charming, remodeled 1,600-square-foot home with two bedrooms and two bathrooms has three levels for enjoying the Yunguilla countryside. Asking price is $85,000.

As a result, the respiratory system of the late Rohey Mbaye consequently failed to pass air to her lungs, thus causing the deceased to suffocate and die. This was revealed by Dr Abdoulie Ceesay, a medical practitioner attached to the Accident and Emergency Unit of the RVTH, when he testified before Justice Richards of the Special Criminal Court in the murder trial of one Isatou Foon. According to Dr Ceesay, apart from the fractures in the cervical vertebrate of the deceased, her diaphragm failed to contract when her nerves paralyzed resulting in no contraction of the deceased?s diaphragm. Dr. Ceesay further testified that it was sometime last year when he conducted a postmortem on the corpse of the deceased, and wrote a report to that effect. Responding to questions by lawyer Pap Cheyassin Secka the defence counsel, Dr. Ceesay said that any strong outside force on the neck can cause a fracture. He added that it is possible for a child to fall from her mother in heavy waves, and sustain a neck fracture. Also testifying was one Mustapha Sowe, a police officer attached to the Major Crime Unit in Banjul, who also informed the court that he recorded the cautionary and voluntary statement of the accused person.\n\n=== 질문 ===\nWho is the founder of Lionsgate Design Inc.?\n\n=== 요청사항 ===\n주어진 컨텍스트를 바탕으로 질문에 답변해주세요.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Tina Marie Singh is the founder of Lionsgate Design Inc.", "role": "assistant"}], "type": "positive", "original_question": "Who is the founder of Lionsgate Design Inc.?", "original_answer": "Tina Marie Singh is the founder of Lionsgate Design Inc."}

At Ford (F), sales plunged 41 percent, and Chrysler reported a 39 percent drop. The big Japanese automakers fared little better. March had all the makings of another dismal month for U.S. auto sales: Unemployment is rising, there's no bottom in sight for home prices, and even stocks' recent rally hasn't come close to erasing this year's losses. Then there's the desperate state of the automakers themselves: GM faces a government-mandated break up and Chrysler is under orders to make a deal with Italian automaker Fiat. Ford may be widely regarded as the healthiest of the \"Detroit Three\" and the only one not currently on life support, but evidently that hasn't helped them overcome the recession's downward pull on sales. Among Japanese car companies, Nissan said March sales fell 38 percent and Toyota reported a 39 percent decline in sales. Honda's sales dropped 36 percent last month, the company said. The smaller players in the U.S. market also released their March figures. Subaru reported March sales fell 2.6 percent from last year. Strong demand for its Forester SUV blunted a big decline among its smaller cars. And Volkswagon said it sold 19.5 percent fewer cars last month than a year earlier, with its Jetta, Rabbit and Passat models all seeing big declines.\n\n컨텍스트 2: Event Information Date and time Location Online event About this event We are the ones we’ve been waiting for.

Then they went somewhere and when they came back they said they found us a new place to live and we'll go live there in less than a month and I wanted to know how long that was and Max said \"Not enough sleeps, I'm sure.\" So I took the mousie and I dropped it at the Mom's feet again and she said \"Don't you ever get tired of this?\" and I said NOPE so she threw the mousie again and I fetched it.

On the practical side though, I am looking for a DIY idea (iDIYa?) for making her a desk. The problem is that the custom sized desks are too high for little ones (especially my little one how is on the 5th percentile), and when they sit on a “grown up” chair their feet kind of dangle, and they squirm (OK, this maybe happens only to my kids, and has to do with ADHD?). Any way, I did notice that when they sit on a “kid size” chair, and their feet reach the floor, they don’t wiggle as much, and can sit longer. So I’m looking for an easy and non expensive idea for a low desk (about 50 cm=19.7 inch), that I know will only last a few years before she grows (hopefully) tall enough for a regular desk. Another thing though, is that I need drawers for this desk for all of her office supplies. I found this beautiful idea for turning a dresses into a desk by the creative Alicia from “Thrifty and Chic“, and its definitely inspirational:. If you have seen (or created) a DIY tutorials for desks, I’d be very happy to hear from you, and see your iDIYas.

Every local shop is different and requires an individual assessment for what action a retailer may need to take. The new guidance includes information on crime prevention equipment including CCTV, external security measures, and locating high value product in sight of the till. The Crime Guidance is broken into four main sections: - Working in Partnership: This section highlights the importance of having great links with local police and other agencies. Partnership work is the most effective way to prevent retail crime and responding to it quickly. - Violence and Verbal Abuse: This section focuses on the triggers for abuse that could result in violence and verbal abuse towards retailers and staff. - Robbery: Self scan tills in store are an emerging trend that support quick service for ‘time-poor’ customers, but they can also present opportunities to shop thieves. This guidance sets out some ideas for best practice for retailers and products that cause customer difficulty. - Staff Theft: This advises retailers on preventing incidents of staff theft, how to identify staff theft and how to deal with offenders.

Do not use on public roads. Remember to wear protective equipment such as elbow pads, knee pads and a helmet. The rigid shell (hard boot) provides your child with lasting protection and good ankle support. These skates are easy to put on and tighten thanks to the buckles that hold your foot in place. Once you've found the right position, no further adjustments are needed! How do you put on and fasten the skates? It's child's play! The tongue on the front of the boots lets you adjust them to three sizes. This means that the skates grow with your child. The wide opening makes them easy to put on. The brakes and wheels (small: 63mm) are made from PU (polyurethane) for grip, safety and handling. The. Oxelo is committed to helping your child skate safely, whatever their technical ability. We have chosen to fit all our children's products with rubber wheels and brakes instead of PVC, because our number one concern is your child's safety. Unlike plastic, which skids but doesn't brake, rubber provides good traction. This stops your child from slipping when they push off, as well as helping them brake effectively. Rubber also wears out less quickly than plastic. Repair and maintain your skates with the spare parts available in-store from the department or the workshop. Find our advice and tutorials on the Oxelo YouTube channel: The brakes can be used on the right or left (spare brake pads available in-store, ref. 8110638). To make your wheels last longer, swap them into different positions to even out the wear. The boot can be machine washed at 30°C.. Don't forget!\n\n컨텍스트 3: So. . . I looked it up online tonight. \"It\" being the deadline for turning in my dissertation. Ends up it's my 31st birthday. Which is less than four months away. Oh. My. God. So that's lit a real fire under me. I cleared off my desk, located folders that have been AWOL since the move, and I'm ready to write. (So of course here I am, blogging away.) Truth is, I've been dawdling a bit of late and blaming it on family responsibilities or the mountains of papers we all grade.

The company said it intends to use the net proceeds of the loans, together with available cash of USD 120.6 million, to refinance four out of five of its existing credit facilities amounting to a total of USD 580.6 million. Capital Product Partners entered into a firm offer letter for the loan facility with HSH Nordbank and ING Bank as mandated lead arrangers and bookrunners and BNP Paribas and National Bank of Greece S.A. as arrangers in late May. The lenders also include Alpha Bank S.A., Piraeus Bank S.A. and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (Publ). The closing of the credit facility, which has a six year maturity from drawdown, is subject to finalization of the long form loan documentation. The loan is comprised of two tranches, one amounting to the lower of USD 259 million and 57.5% of the value of 11 of the company’s vessels with an average age of 3 years. The second tranche amounts to the lower of USD 201 million and 57.5% of the value of 24 of its vessels with an average age of 10.3 years. The company unveiled the financing as part of its financial results for the second quarter of 2017. The Partnership’s net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 was USD 9.8 million compared with USD 14.9 million for the second quarter of 2016. Total revenues for the second quarter of 2017 reached USD 62.1 million corresponding to an increase of 2% compared to USD 60.9 million during the second quarter of 2016. The increase in total revenues was primarily a result of the expansion of Capital Product Partners’ fleet, partly offset by the lower charter rates earned by certain vessels compared to the second quarter of 2016.\n\n컨텍스트 3: High unemployment in the West Bank and Gaza is leaving Palestinians with little alternative to taking jobs in Israel and the settlements. More than 130,000 people try to earn a living in this way. The report exposes the reality of: - low wages; - poor occupational health and safety; - the humiliation of having to queue at border crossings to enter Israel; - gaps in social protection; - and the oppressive labour broker system that many workers are still forced to use, even though the system has been removed by the Israeli authorities in the construction sector. Root causes Sharan Burrow, ITUC General Secretary, said: “Israel’s continued occupation of Palestine and the illegal settlements are the root causes of the plight of these workers who depend on Israel for their livelihoods and the household members who depend on them in turn. “Only when Palestine becomes an independent state existing alongside Israel, in line with the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, can its economy flourish and its people no longer have to rely on substandard employment. “The US administration’s resumption of financial support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) will make a major difference in Palestine, but Palestinian workers who rely on Israel for employment deserve fair treatment, decent wages and respect for their fundamental rights.” Key recommendations in the report include: - A complete end to the exploitative labour broker system. - Respect for the fundamental rights of the workers, in line with the floor of labour protections guaranteed in the ILO Centenary Declaration including an adequate minimum wage. - Occupational health and safety and maximum limits on working hours. - Labour inspection. - Social protection. - Due diligence requirements on employers. “On top of the injustice of occupation, Palestinian workers in Israel and the illegal settlements face injustice at work as well. Israel must fulfill its obligations under international law,” said Sharan Burrow.\n\n컨텍스트 4: 06 August 2012 Explore amazing Olympics photos on a Historypin picture map Keeping with the theme of photos – The Mirror ( ) has created a Historypin map which includes images from 1908 to 2008, so that you can explore the Olympics over the past century, including the London Games of 1908 and 1948.

By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.” (Hebrews 10:9-10) In Psalm 40, David ponders the emptiness of Jewish religion. He concludes “sacrifice and offering you have not desired.” (vs 5) Everyone already knew it. People were faithfully going to church, observing the rituals commanded by God’s word, but missing power! It was a real problem for the man who would build the temple and establish this ceremonial/sacrificial form. In a prophetic moment, David hears Christ speak. He will do the Father’s new will. He will be the needed sacrifice. Perfect in obedience, perfect in effect, perfect in example. We must never go back to a system of religion. Only Christ has the power to cleanse our hearts.

The criterion was developed by Dr. Niyama, a Japanese researcher studying shrinkage prediction in steel. Niyama found that the Temperature Gradient divided by the square root of the Cooling Rate corresponded to the presence of shrinkage porosity in steel castings. The lower the value, the higher the probability of shrinkage. If this number were 1 or above there was little or no shrinkage porosity in the castings. Niyama has been used extensively for shrinkage prediction in castings, until the use of more advanced calculations such as the Material Density Function. The Niyama Criterion has been extended to alloys other than steel. Niyama is basically a prediction of directional solidification. Poor directional solidification is represented by a value of 0, good directional solidification by higher values. Ranges of critical values are: Steels: 0 1 Cast Irons: 0 0.75 Aluminum: 0 0.30 Copper Base 0 1.30 The general idea is that the lower the value of Niyama, the worse the potential for shrinkage. A value of 0 is the highest probability of shrinkage, and as the value increases, the severity of the probable porosity decreases. Above the critical number, probability of porosity is low. Niyama plots need interpretation, because they give low values in many areas where temperature gradients are low but shrinkage might not be likely, such as at the centerline of thin-wall areas and at the dividing line between the feeding areas of two risers. Also, Niyama is based only on heat transfer and does not take the effect of gravity into account. For most ferrous materials, Material Density (which DOES take gravity into account) is generally a better indicator. Niyama, however, is still used heavily in many non-ferrous applications (typically in aluminum alloys).\n\n컨텍스트 3: As someone who follows quite a few web comic series and has started and forgotten a few of his own, I’ve always gotten a kick out of people who give the artists and authors crap for not posting frequently enough. It’s like, “Hey dick, you’re not producing your free Internet content at a pace that is conducive of my unappreciative viewing experience, and that makes me hate you!” I actually like those types of trolls – those that call themselves “fans” – better than the “This thing you made sucks” crowd, because they feel like they actually deserve the right to criticize someone’s work. That said, someone introduced me to the web comics of artist J.O. Applegate during the 2012 NBA Playoffs, and I write with completely aware irony today – HE DOES NOT POST HIS COMICS ENOUGH. Applegate’s web comics, known collectively as Bounce Bounce Bounce or BounceX3, are mostly standalone jokes about certain players or the NBA experience in general, but his takes on fan and player behaviors are so dead on and hilarious, especially his latest work after the jump, that I almost consider them therapeutic to look at when I think about how insane most NBA fans are. Most of all, I’m jealous of the awesome way that Applegate ties GIF animation into his comics, because I’m still trying to figure out how to do that and I should just probably realize that I’m a big ol’ dummy already. Alas, I digress.

[2], tamarind balls, chip-chip to name a few, it also seems that there have been many casualties of industrialization and foreign influence. As thebookmann blogged in his entry “Green Paw Paw Balls and Paradise Plum” [3], [4] has been a great stop-gap measure, however the. [5] [6], I have in recent years keenly noted how Child’s legacy has been upheld and revered not just by the institution through it’s now annual Julia Child Day [7], but also the high regard with which the US mainstream and government treated her work. Not only are her programs still in rotation (on PBS and the Cooking Channel [8]), but PBS also has a wonderfully exhaustive portal dedicated to her programs and works [9]. Furthermore, the Smithsonian Institute painstakingly deconstructed and recreated her kitchen for permanent display [10] [11], Trinifood [12] and Caribbean Pot [13]. We have all made nods and mention of her in one way or another, as has Trini beauty blogger Afrobella [14]. Where institutional praise is non-existent I can only hope that what she inspired in each of us will be enough to keep her name and face around just a little bit longer.

More than 130,000 people try to earn a living in this way. The report exposes the reality of: - low wages; - poor occupational health and safety; - the humiliation of having to queue at border crossings to enter Israel; - gaps in social protection; - and the oppressive labour broker system that many workers are still forced to use, even though the system has been removed by the Israeli authorities in the construction sector. Root causes Sharan Burrow, ITUC General Secretary, said: “Israel’s continued occupation of Palestine and the illegal settlements are the root causes of the plight of these workers who depend on Israel for their livelihoods and the household members who depend on them in turn. “Only when Palestine becomes an independent state existing alongside Israel, in line with the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, can its economy flourish and its people no longer have to rely on substandard employment. “The US administration’s resumption of financial support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) will make a major difference in Palestine, but Palestinian workers who rely on Israel for employment deserve fair treatment, decent wages and respect for their fundamental rights.” Key recommendations in the report include: - A complete end to the exploitative labour broker system. - Respect for the fundamental rights of the workers, in line with the floor of labour protections guaranteed in the ILO Centenary Declaration including an adequate minimum wage. - Occupational health and safety and maximum limits on working hours. - Labour inspection. - Social protection. - Due diligence requirements on employers. “On top of the injustice of occupation, Palestinian workers in Israel and the illegal settlements face injustice at work as well. Israel must fulfill its obligations under international law,” said Sharan Burrow.\n\n=== 질문 ===\nWhat is the new planet mentioned in the first quote of the Spongebob Caveman quotes?\n\n=== 요청사항 ===\n주어진 컨텍스트를 바탕으로 질문에 답변해주세요.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "The new planet mentioned in the first quote is Uranus.", "role": "assistant"}], "type": "positive", "original_question": "What is the new planet mentioned in the first quote of the Spongebob Caveman quotes?", "original_answer": "The new planet mentioned in the first quote is Uranus."}

The criterion was developed by Dr. Niyama, a Japanese researcher studying shrinkage prediction in steel. Niyama found that the Temperature Gradient divided by the square root of the Cooling Rate corresponded to the presence of shrinkage porosity in steel castings. The lower the value, the higher the probability of shrinkage. If this number were 1 or above there was little or no shrinkage porosity in the castings. Niyama has been used extensively for shrinkage prediction in castings, until the use of more advanced calculations such as the Material Density Function. The Niyama Criterion has been extended to alloys other than steel. Niyama is basically a prediction of directional solidification. Poor directional solidification is represented by a value of 0, good directional solidification by higher values. Ranges of critical values are: Steels: 0 1 Cast Irons: 0 0.75 Aluminum: 0 0.30 Copper Base 0 1.30 The general idea is that the lower the value of Niyama, the worse the potential for shrinkage. A value of 0 is the highest probability of shrinkage, and as the value increases, the severity of the probable porosity decreases. Above the critical number, probability of porosity is low. Niyama plots need interpretation, because they give low values in many areas where temperature gradients are low but shrinkage might not be likely, such as at the centerline of thin-wall areas and at the dividing line between the feeding areas of two risers. Also, Niyama is based only on heat transfer and does not take the effect of gravity into account. For most ferrous materials, Material Density (which DOES take gravity into account) is generally a better indicator. Niyama, however, is still used heavily in many non-ferrous applications (typically in aluminum alloys).\n\n컨텍스트 2: 2001 Lincoln LS Q&A 2001 Lincoln LS Question: air bag light on meaning and cost? - remem Answer 1 Good afternoon, It sounds like you may have a bad clock spring.

We’ve unboxed it below and before you get over excited, it’s the flat screen 5.9 inch Full HD version, not the 5.5 inch curved screen 6 GB RAM model. Anyway, it’s priced at $600 on Amazon and it’s quite the looker. Inside its box there’s a big charger with fast charging, USB Type C cable, headphones, USB Type C to microUSB adapter, a case and manuals, plus the metal key used to access the slots. This big metal phablet is also an occasion for us to get our first contact with EMUI 5.0, on top of Android 7.0 Nougat. The handset measures 7.9 mm in thickness, exactly like the Galaxy S7 and Note 7 and weighs a hefty 190 grams. Inside we find an octa core Kirin 960 processor, 4 GB of RAM, 64 GB of storage and a microSD card slot, plus a 4000 mAh battery. There’s a dual camera at the back, with a 20 MP monochrome sensor and 12 MP RGB sensor, as well as dual LED flash, OIS and laser focus. Leica technology is still used here, in an evolved version. There’s a front 8 MP cam for selfies and I was surprised to see just how much the UI has changed here. The menu backgrounds are now black, we get blue toggles and I’ve heard this interface is inspired by the Aegean culture. This probably explains the marine blue used among the icons, Settings menu and more. Huawei has integrated a fingerprint scanner here too. In USA this phone sells with Amazon Alexa preinstalled and it was showcased at CES 2017. My first impression was that we’re dealing with a very solid Galaxy Note 7 rival, that would have competed with it even if it had no problems. It’s well built, premium looking and the camera has a ton of options. We look forward to testing it over the next days. In the meantime you can get the device here.\n\n=== 질문 ===\nWhat was the cause of death of Rohey Mbaye according to the postmortem report?\n\n=== 요청사항 ===\n주어진 컨텍스트를 바탕으로 질문에 답변해주세요.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "The cause of death of Rohey Mbaye was suffocation due to a fracture at the level 4 and 5 of the cervical vertebrate which caused her respiratory system to fail to pass air to her lungs.", "role": "assistant"}], "type": "negative", "original_question": "What was the cause of death of Rohey Mbaye according to the postmortem report?", "original_answer": "The cause of death of Rohey Mbaye was suffocation due to a fracture at the level 4 and 5 of the cervical vertebrate which caused her respiratory system to fail to pass air to her lungs."}

I really do. I have a great Mother (who reads the blog daily and is one of my biggest fans- Hi Smoj), a proud Father (who tends to be computer illiterate and will not see this), and an awesome little brother (who will be graduating from Law School in May). But what I don't have is a Sister. I've never had one, nor will I. I will have women I love like sisters, but never an actual one. And that's okay! But these gals right here have sisters that are right there with them. And here they are. These are the Pastel Lesser Sisters. They are sassy and bright and absolutely gorgeous. And they know it. And the Spider het Axanthic Sisters. They are golden tan, well patterned and know how to work it. And they don't have the wobbles. Who could ask for more? And last but not least... The Pied Sister Trio. They are rough and tumble, will take on any thing (including decent sized rats), and like to get wet (they love tossing over their water bowls, as the pictures show). These gals are fantastic. So... even though I don't have a Sister (which is perfectly fine by me), I have all these gals to love and enjoy. Who could ask for more?? Have a fantastic weekend, my friends. 2 comments: Great Blog.. awesome pictures! Keep up the good work! That's a lot of sisters! Beautiful girls you have there! Some of my boys have sisters.

Minister Schmit stated that \"the physical reception of ADEM's clients also forms part of the important points of the reform. A good reception means better service to our customers.\" Wiltz's Mayor, Fränk Arndt, commented \"as a regional capital of the Ardennes, Wiltz has the ambition to offer its residents optimal infrastructure and accessibility to all public services. The new regional ADEM offices in Wiltz and the development of the services offered there are part of the strategic vision of our town.\" In all, 11 employees work in this agency, twice more than ten years ago. As Nathalie Velikonia, head of the agency, explained: \"ADEM Wiltz offers various services to job seekers: personalised monitoring as well as the supervision of jobseekers with the status of the disabled; unemployment benefits and the organisation of workshops on the job search. The Inspectorate of Labour and Mines (ITM) also holds a permanence.\" \"Following the renovation of the agency in Diekirch and the ongoing work in Luxembourg City, this new Wiltz agency allows us to optimally accommodate our customers optimally,\" concluded Isabelle Schlesser, Director of ADEM. \"We also take advantage of our small agencies to launch pilot projects. At Wiltz, we will start a project to improve the mobility of job seekers.\" Photo by ADEM (L-R): Nathalie Velikonia,Head of the agency in Wiltz; Gaby Wagner, deputy director of the ADEM; Fränk Arndt, Mayor of Wiltz; Isabelle Schlesser, Director of ADEM; Nicolas Schmit, Minister of Labour, Employment, Social and Solidarity Economy; Romain Schneider, Minister for Social Security\n\n컨텍스트 4: Description My little one is going to start school in september (I’m kind of emotional about it…). On the practical side though, I am looking for a DIY idea (iDIYa?) for making her a desk. The problem is that the custom sized desks are too high for little ones (especially my little one how is on the 5th percentile), and when they sit on a “grown up” chair their feet kind of dangle, and they squirm (OK, this maybe happens only to my kids, and has to do with ADHD?). Any way, I did notice that when they sit on a “kid size” chair, and their feet reach the floor, they don’t wiggle as much, and can sit longer. So I’m looking for an easy and non expensive idea for a low desk (about 50 cm=19.7 inch), that I know will only last a few years before she grows (hopefully) tall enough for a regular desk. Another thing though, is that I need drawers for this desk for all of her office supplies. I found this beautiful idea for turning a dresses into a desk by the creative Alicia from “Thrifty and Chic“, and its definitely inspirational:. If you have seen (or created) a DIY tutorials for desks, I’d be very happy to hear from you, and see your iDIYas.

Small but well-stocked would probably best describe it. The festival had been running from Thursday so I expected when turning up on Saturday afternoon, the last day of the event, that there would have been a shortage of beer. However, unlike other beer festivals that seem to start running very low remarkably quickly, there were very few ‘sold out’ signs when I left at 7:00pm (despite my best efforts!). The school sportshall in which the festival was held was nicely laid out with local beers, and perries and ciders, on one side and national beers on the other and plenty of leaning posts in between. I got stuck into quite a few, favouring darker beers as usual, but there were also some nicer best bitters and lighter, more summery brews – although the 10% bitter I tried last would tempt me back! The music made quite a change with a local brass band playing for much our the afternoon. The only bad thing about the event was the weather – nice, warm and sunny – so it seemed a bit of a pity to spend the day inside. However, this might be another event to keep in my diary for next year.\n\n컨텍스트 3: Andhra to launch India’s first govt run ambulance network for animals Mobile ambulances shall provide veterinary first aid services along with spot diagnosis and attending to emergency cases To further boost the animal husbandry and veterinary sector in Andhra Pradesh, the state government has now decided to set up “India’s first government-run ambulance network” for animals. Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has made one of its main missions to help reach out to the distressed animals and provide them with proper animal healthcare. The Animal Husbandry Department has been further directed to set up one Mobile Ambulance Veterinary Clinic at every assembly constituency, the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said. A total of 175 mobile ambulances (veterinary) clinics will be placed at Assembly Constituency Level on the lines of 108 Services for providing Veterinary services at the doorstep. These mobile ambulances shall provide veterinary first aid services along with spot diagnosis and attending to emergency cases. One of the major facilities these ambulances will provide is the ‘Hydraulic Lift’ facility to lift animals and shift them to the nearest Government Veterinary Facility in case of emergency. One veterinary doctor, One Para-veterinary worker, will be assigned to every ambulance. These ambulances will also have a 24/7 toll-free call centre. The department of Animal Husbandry has briefed the Chief Minister that there are around 1,576 veterinary dispensaries established across the state, with around 1,376 veterinary doctors recruited. The Chief Minister said that more veterinary doctors need access for better functioning and better treatment. Stressing further on the medications being supplied, Reddy had directed the officials to ensure that quality medication should be provided to animals.\n\n컨텍스트 4: The hexadecimal color code #f9f1c9 is a very light shade of yellow.

It’s like, “Hey dick, you’re not producing your free Internet content at a pace that is conducive of my unappreciative viewing experience, and that makes me hate you!” I actually like those types of trolls – those that call themselves “fans” – better than the “This thing you made sucks” crowd, because they feel like they actually deserve the right to criticize someone’s work. That said, someone introduced me to the web comics of artist J.O. Applegate during the 2012 NBA Playoffs, and I write with completely aware irony today – HE DOES NOT POST HIS COMICS ENOUGH. Applegate’s web comics, known collectively as Bounce Bounce Bounce or BounceX3, are mostly standalone jokes about certain players or the NBA experience in general, but his takes on fan and player behaviors are so dead on and hilarious, especially his latest work after the jump, that I almost consider them therapeutic to look at when I think about how insane most NBA fans are. Most of all, I’m jealous of the awesome way that Applegate ties GIF animation into his comics, because I’m still trying to figure out how to do that and I should just probably realize that I’m a big ol’ dummy already. Alas, I digress. After the jump, I’ve included Applegate’s most recent efforts, dating from the start of this season to last season’s playoffs, and if you’re an NBA fan, you should absolutely follow him and complain like an impatient child like I do when a day goes by without a new comic. Been staring at Andre touching his mustache (#13) for about 5mins now…it’s mesmerizing. These are super great.

Source: Magness et al. 1971Source: Magness et al. 1971 Manioc, or Cassava, is a highly important food crop of the tropics and is grown to some extent in the Southern States, mainly for stock feed. The plant is a large herbaceous shrub up to 10 feet, resembling castor bean in appearance, with large, compound leaves. It is cultivated for the large, tuberous roots which are rich in starch and are the source of tapioca, Brazilian arrow root, and other foods. The tuberous roots form in a cluster at the stem base. Plants are propagated by stem pieces laid horizontally in furrows, somewhat like sugar cane. The roots used as food sources are formed entirely underground. Only 15 acres were reported for continental U.S., 1954 census, but there is substantial production in Puerto Rico and Hawaii.\n\n컨텍스트 3: The focus of this show is experimental music from Iran, ahead of our UK residency for Iranians musicians and sound artists Iran-UK Sonics.

Yes I did not format the memory card at the very beginning, but the emulator never asked me to format it and the game was able to save until now. (12-01-2013, 03:28 AM)Hall of Famer Wrote: I dont think so, but perhaps I did press a key that does this. How to switch card btw? (12-01-2013, 03:31 AM)Blyss Sarania Wrote: There is no key for that, you have to do it through the menus. The way saving works in the original Ar tonelico in PCSX2 has given me problems before. Specifically, you know how you have 15 save slots in game? No matter which slot I choose, it ONLY saves the most recent one. Granted, this was about a year ago. If all else fails and you can't get it back, I might have a save around where you were. Most of my saves are towards the end of the game on Aurica's path though. (12-01-2013, 03:39 AM)Hall of Famer Wrote: Well thats a bit different. In my game I have only 12 slots, but I can save anywhere I want to(granted that I am in the Inn or a camp location). I normally make use of all these slots to make sure I can go back to an earlier slot in case I want to restart at that point(possibly due to missing some items/quests that cannot be recovered). The save file started malfunctioning since I accessed the 11th save slot, and then the game keeps saying that the memory card is not formatted. Is there really nothing I can do other than starting over? (12-01-2013, 03:43 AM)Blyss Sarania Wrote: Attach your memcard here. I may be able to extract the save and put it on a good card for you. You will need to compress the memcard so it's not huge. Alternatively you can upload it to a filehost somewhere. If the save data is still in the card, even if it's corrupted, I'm pretty sure I can get at it.\n\n=== 질문 ===\nWhat is the focus of the show mentioned in the context?\n\n=== 요청사항 ===\n주어진 컨텍스트를 바탕으로 질문에 답변해주세요.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "The focus of this show is experimental music from Iran, ahead of the UK residency for Iranians musicians and sound artists Iran-UK Sonics.", "role": "assistant"}], "type": "positive", "original_question": "What is the focus of the show mentioned in the context?", "original_answer": "The focus of this show is experimental music from Iran, ahead of the UK residency for Iranians musicians and sound artists Iran-UK Sonics."}
